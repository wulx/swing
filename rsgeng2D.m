%
% [f,x,y] = rsgeng2D(N,rL,h,clx,cly) 
%
% generates a square 2-dimensional random rough surface f(x,y) with NxN 
% surface points. The surface has a Gaussian height distribution function 
% and Gaussian autocovariance functions (in both x and y), where rL is the 
% length of the surface side, h is the RMS height and clx and cly are the 
% correlation lengths in x and y. Omitting cly makes the surface isotropic.
%
% Input:    N   - number of surface points (along square side)
%           rL  - length of surface (along square side)
%           h   - rms height
%           clx, (cly)  - correlation lengths (in x and y)
%
% Output:   f  - surface heights
%           x  - surface points
%           y  - surface points
